# Fluvio Test Runner

Used to run a various test against `Fluvio` platform.

This assumes you have read Fluvio doc and setup or access to a Fluvio cluster .



## Setting up Test runer

Build all `Fluvio` crates. 

```
cargo build
```

Set up alias to run development version of Fluvio and Test runner CLI.

```
alias flvd=./target/debug/fluvio
alias flvt=./target/debug/flv-test

```


# Running Test runner

Test runner can be a running in two ways:
- Create new cluster (local or k8) and run tests (smoke test)
- Run tests againts existing cluster


## Smoke test

This run a simple smoke test by creating new local cluster.

It creates a simple topic: `topic0` and perform produce/consume 

```
$ flvt --local

....various cluster installation
start testing...
found topic: topic0 offset: 0
starting produce
Ok!
send message of len 108
topic: topic0, consume message validated!
```

Smoke test can be specified with more than 1 iterations:

Run a test with sending 10 records:
```
flvt  --local --produce-iteration 10

no setup
no topic initialized
start testing...
found topic: topic0 offset: 1
starting fetch stream for: topic0 at: 1, expected new records: 10
consumer: received batches 0
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 1,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 1, validated offset: 2
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 2,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 2, validated offset: 3
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 3,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 3, validated offset: 4
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 4,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 4, validated offset: 5
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 5,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 5, validated offset: 6
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 6,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 6, validated offset: 7
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 7,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 7, validated offset: 8
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 8,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 8, validated offset: 9
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 9,len: 108
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 9, validated offset: 10
produced message topic: topic0, offset: 10,len: 109
consumer: received batches 1
   consumer: total records: 10, validated offset: 11
<<consume test done for: topic0 >>>>
consume message validated!
