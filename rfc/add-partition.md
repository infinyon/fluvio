# Add partition

## Overview

Fluvio topics can be set up with multiple partitions in the moment of creation. However, it is a requested feature to add partitions to an existing topic.

## Step-by-step

1. Start a Fluvio cluster with multiple SPUs.

```bash
$ fluvio cluster start --spu 3
```

2. Create a topic with a single partition.

```bash
$ fluvio topic create my-topic
```

3. Verify the initial number of partitions.

```bash
$ fluvio partition list
  NAME      TYPE      PARTITIONS  REPLICAS  RETENTION TIME  COMPRESSION  DEDUPLICATION  STATUS                   REASON
  my-topic  computed  1           1         7days           any          none           resolution::provisioned
```

4. Add a partition to the topic.

```bash
$ fluvio topic add-partition my-topic
added new partitions to topic "my-topic":
PARTITION   SPU
1           5002
```

5. Verify the number of partitions.

```bash
$ fluvio topic list
  NAME      TYPE      PARTITIONS  REPLICAS  RETENTION TIME  COMPRESSION  DEDUPLICATION  STATUS                   REASON
  my-topic  computed  2           1         7days           any          none           resolution::provisioned
```

6. Verify the partition details.

```bash
$ fluvio partition list --topic my-topic
$ fluvio partition list -t my-topic
  TOPIC     PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR  REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  my-topic  0          5001            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
  my-topic  1          5002            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
```

## Adding multiples partitions

It's possible specify the number of partitions to add.

```bash
$ fluvio topic add-partition my-topic --count 2
$ fluvio topic add-partition my-topic -c 2
added new partitions to topic "my-topic":
PARTITION   SPU
2           5003
3           5001
```

Check new partitions:

```bash
$ fluvio partition list --topic my-topic
$ fluvio partition list -t my-topic
  TOPIC     PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR  REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE  HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
  my-topic  0          5001            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
  my-topic  1          5002            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
  my-topic  2          5003            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
  my-topic  3          5001            []        Online      0 B   0   0    0    0                 []
``

## Produce messages

Fluvio producers must produce messages to a new partition, even if this partition were created after the produce connection.

1. Produce messages to the topic.

```bash
$ fluvio create my-topic
$ fluvio produce my-topic
> A
Ok!
> B
Ok!
$ fluvio partition list
TOPIC     PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR  REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE   HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
my-topic  0          5001            []        Online      138 B  2   2    2    0                 []
```

2. Add a new partition to the topic.

```bash
$ fluvio topic add-partition my-topic
```

Back to the producer, it must produce messages to the new partition.

```bash
> C
Ok!
> D
Ok!

$ fluvio partition list
TOPIC     PARTITION  LEADER  MIRROR  REPLICAS  RESOLUTION  SIZE   HW  LEO  LRS  FOLLOWER OFFSETS
my-topic  0          5001            []        Online      207 B  3   3    3    0                 []
my-topic  1          5001            []        Online      69 B   1   1    1    0                 []
```

## Consume messages

Fluvio consumers must to consume messages from a new partition when consuming a topic reading from all partition.
Based on the previous example, if we start to the consumer command before the new partition is added, it must read all messsages, even from the new partition.

```bash
$ fluvio consume my-topic
A
C
B
D
```

## Partition rebalancing

Adding a partition will not rebalance the data from the existing partitions. The rebalancing will happen naturally after the records age.

The new data will be distribuited across all partitions, including the newly added partitions.
