Fluvio is a cloud-native platform for data-in-motion, built from the ground up to run on Kubernetes.  
It brings centralized control to connect, transform, and distribute real-time data across the organization.

The repository contains all the code necessary to run the Fluvio platform: Services, APIs, and the CLI.
