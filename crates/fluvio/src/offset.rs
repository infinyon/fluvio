/// Describes the location of an event stored in a Fluvio partition
///
/// All Fluvio events are stored as a log inside a partition. A log
/// is just an ordered list, and an `Offset` is just a way to select
/// an item from that list. There are several ways that an `Offset`
/// may identify an element from a log. Suppose you sent some
/// multiples of `11` to your partition. The various offset types
/// would look like this:
///
/// ```text
///         Partition Log: [ 00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 ]
///       Absolute Offset:    0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6
///  FromBeginning Offset:    0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6
///        FromEnd Offset:    6,  5,  4,  3,  2,  1,  0
/// ```
///
/// When a new partition is created, it always starts counting new
/// events at the `Absolute` offset of 0. An absolute offset is a
/// unique index that represents the event's distance from the very
/// beginning of the partition. The absolute offset of an event never
/// changes.
///
/// Fluvio allows you to set a retention policy that determines how
/// long your events should live. Once an event has outlived your
/// retention policy, Fluvio may delete it to save resources. Whenever
/// it does this, it keeps track of the latest non-deleted event. This
/// allows the `FromBeginning` offset to select an event which is a
/// certain number of places in front of the deleted range. For example,
/// let's say that the first two events from our partition were deleted.
/// Our new offsets would look like this:
///
/// ```text
///                          These events were deleted!
///                          |
///                          vvvvvv
///         Partition Log: [ .., .., 22, 33, 44, 55, 66 ]
///       Absolute Offset:    0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6
///  FromBeginning Offset:            0,  1,  2,  3,  4
///        FromEnd Offset:    6,  5,  4,  3,  2,  1,  0
/// ```
///
/// Just like the `FromBeginning` offset may change if events are deleted,
/// the `FromEnd` offset will change when new events are added. Let's take
/// a look:
///
/// ```text
///                                        These events were added!
///                                                               |
///                                                      vvvvvvvvvv
